# Malaria-Classification-using-CNN

 In this project the Classification is done with the help of infected and unifected cells images dataset.
 
   Using Convolution Neural Network and Keras (which is a high level API for machine learning) 
    
   Google colab is used because google colab provides GPU and TPU which reduces lots of time.
